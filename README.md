# Term-Project-112
#
# asteroids.py is the main file. The project only uses 112 graphics, so no modules are needed. Certain parts of the code have not been implemented yet, such as sliceFunction.py and clipping.py. test.py is temporary and will be deleted soon.
#
# Most of the important code is in player.py, asteroids.py, and ray.py.
